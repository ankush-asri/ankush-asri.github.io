  I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Economics at the University of Konstanz and at the Thurgau Institute of Economics (TWI). I am also affiliated with the Cluster of Excellence "Politics of Inequality" at the University of Konstanz.
    <br>

Prior to that, I completed my PhD from the Department of Economics at the University of Bologna in October 2019. 
    <br>

My research interests are in the areas of Behavioral Economics and Experimental Economics. I currently work on factors affecting the intergroup relations in a culturally diverse society and the effects of inequality of opportunity based on caste and gender.
